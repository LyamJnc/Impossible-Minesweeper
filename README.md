# Impossible minesweeper
## Original idea from [MattKC](http://www.mattkc.com/etc/winmine)

### I modified the original minesweeper for windows 95 and made it impossible, i made some tweaks over mattkc's mod.

## Mul
### I modified the assembly code so that it sets the amount of bombs based on a multiplication of the number of columns and rows.

## Overwritten code
### I disabled the code that moves a bomb if it's the first tile you click on.
